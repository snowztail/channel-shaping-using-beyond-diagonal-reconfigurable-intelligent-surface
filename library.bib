   abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) allow controlling the propagation environment in wireless networks by tuning multiple reflecting elements. RISs have been traditionally realized through single connected architectures, mathematically characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix. Recently, beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs) have been proposed as a novel branch of RISs whose scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal, which creates new benefits and opportunities for RISs. Efficient BD-RIS architectures have been realized based on group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks. However, a closed-form solution for the global optimal scattering matrix of these architectures is not yet available. In this paper, we provide such a closed-form solution proving that the theoretical performance upper bounds can be exactly achieved for any channel realization. We first consider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input single-output (SISO) systems aided by a BD-RIS working in reflective or transmissive mode. Then, we extend our solution to single-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. We show that our algorithm is less complex than the iterative optimization algorithms employed in the previous literature. The complexity of our algorithm grows linearly (resp. cubically) with the number of RIS elements in the case of group (resp. fully) connected architectures.},

   abstract = {Construction-related enterprises are acknowledged as one of the key actors responsible for shifting society toward the sustainable future claimed by the recently established Sustainable Development Goals. However, university curricula need to emphasize guaranteeing the acquisition of transversal competencies that are essential for the future management professionals required by this new challenge Consistent and critical thinking is considered a fundamental skill for education in sustainability. To date, no studies have presented an objective measure of the level of acquisition of such transverse skills in university curricula. This study provides an analytical tool to that end, based on the multi-criteria decision-making technique Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Through sustainability-oriented case studies, students are faced with real managerial decision-making problems. The proposed method allows for the analytic quantification of the consistency of their responses. Such consistency is representative of their critical thinking skills. The proposed tool allows teachers not only to find the consistency of their students' responses but also to understand in which areas of sustainability students lack a clear vision of the problem. This tool is therefore useful for teachers to effectively adapt their syllabi according to their students' knowledge.},

   abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a promising technology for future wireless communications. With various hardware realizations, RISs can work under different modes (reflective/transmissive/hybrid) or have different architectures (single/group/fully-connected). However, most existing research focused on single-connected reflective RISs, mathematically characterized by diagonal phase shift matrices, while there is a lack of a comprehensive study for RISs unifying different modes/architectures. In this paper, we solve this issue by analyzing and proposing a general RIS-aided communication model. Specifically, we establish an RIS model not limited to diagonal phase shift matrices, a novel branch referred to as beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), unifying modes and architectures. With the proposed model, we develop efficient algorithms to jointly design transmit precoder and BD-RIS matrix to maximize the sum-rate for RIS-aided systems. We also provide simulation results to compare the performance of BD-RISs with different modes/architectures. Simulation results show that under the same mode, fully- and group-connected RIS can effectively increase the sum-rate performance compared with single-connected RIS, and that hybrid RIS outperforms reflective/transmissive RIS with the same architecture.},

   abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has gained much traction due to its potential to manipulate the propagation environment via nearly-passive reconfigurable elements. In our previous work, we have analyzed and proposed a beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) model, which is not limited to traditional diagonal phase shift matrices, to unify different RIS modes/architectures. In this paper, we create a new branch of BD-RIS supporting a multi-sector mode. A multi-sector BD-RIS is modeled as multiple antennas connected to a multi-port group-connected reconfigurable impedance network. More specifically, antennas are divided into L ( L ≥ 2 ) sectors and arranged as a polygon prism with each sector covering 1/L space. Different from the recently introduced concept of intelligent omni-surface (or simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS), the multi-sector BD-RIS not only achieves a full-space coverage, but also has significant performance gains thanks to the highly directional beam of each sector. We derive the constraint of the multi-sector BD-RIS and the corresponding channel model taking into account the relationship between antenna beamwidth and gain. With the proposed model, we first derive the scaling law of the received signal power for a multi-sector BD-RIS -assisted single-user system. We then propose efficient beamforming design algorithms to maximize the sum-rate of the multi-sector BD-RIS -assisted multiuser system. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed design and demonstrate the performance enhancement of the proposed multi-sector BD-RIS.},

Accordingly, its special case known as the orthogonal least square regression (OLSR) is under further investigation. Based on the aforementioned studies, we then majorly focus on solving the unbalanced orthogonal procrustes problem (UOPP). As a result, not only a general convergent algorithm is derived theoretically but the efficiency of the proposed approach is verified empirically as well.},
