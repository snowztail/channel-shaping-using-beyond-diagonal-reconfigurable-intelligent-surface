   abstract = {The future of mobile communications looks exciting with the potential new use cases and challenging requirements of future 6th generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks. Since the beginning of the modern era of wireless communications, the propagation medium has been perceived as a randomly behaving entity between the transmitter and the receiver, which degrades the quality of the received signal due to the uncontrollable interactions of the transmitted radio waves with the surrounding objects. The recent advent of reconflgurable intelligent surfaces in wireless communications enables, on the other hand, network operators to control the scattering, reflection, and refraction characteristics of the radiowaves, by overcoming the negative effects of natural wireless propagation. Recent results have revealed that reconflgurable intelligent surfaces can effectively control the wavefront, e.g., the phase, amplitude, frequency, and even polarization, of the impinging signals without the need of complex decoding, encoding, and radio frequency processing operations. Motivated by the potential of this emerging technology, the present article is aimed to provide the readers with a detailed overview and historical perspective on state-of-the-art solutions, and to elaborate on the fundamental differences with other technologies, the most important open research issues to tackle, and the reasons why the use of reconflgurable intelligent surfaces necessitates to rethink the communication-theoretic models currently employed in wireless networks. This article also explores theoretical performance limits of reconflgurable intelligent surface-assisted communication systems using mathematical techniques and elaborates on the potential use cases of intelligent surfaces in 6G and beyond wireless networks.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a revolutionary and transformative technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication cost-effectively in the future. Specifically, an IRS consists of a large number of low-cost passive elements each being able to reflect the incident signal independently with an adjustable phase shift so as to collaboratively achieve three-dimensional (3D) passive beamforming without the need of any transmit radio-frequency (RF) chains. In this paper, we study an IRS-aided single-cell wireless system where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communications between a multi-antenna access point (AP) and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate and solve new problems to minimize the total transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming by active antenna array at the AP and reflect beamforming by passive phase shifters at the IRS, subject to users' individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance of IRS's passive beamforming with infinitely large number of reflecting elements and compare it to that of the traditional active beamforming/relaying. Simulation results demonstrate that an IRS-aided MIMO system can achieve the same rate performance as a benchmark massive MIMO system without using IRS, but with significantly reduced active antennas/RF chains. We also draw useful insights into optimally deploying IRS in future wireless systems.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a cost-effective solution for achieving high spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless networks by leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect the signals with adjustable phase shifts. Prior works on IRS mainly consider continuous phase shifts at reflecting elements, which are practically difficult to implement due to the hardware limitation. In contrast, we study in this paper an IRS-Aided wireless network, where an IRS with only a finite number of phase shifts at each element is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-Antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-Antenna users. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the continuous transmit precoding at the AP and the discrete reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a given set of minimum signal-To-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the user receivers. The considered problem is shown to be a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) and thus is difficult to solve in general. To tackle this problem, we first study the single-user case with one user assisted by the IRS and propose both optimal and suboptimal algorithms for solving it. Besides, we analytically show that as compared to the ideal case with continuous phase shifts, the IRS with discrete phase shifts achieves the same squared power gain in terms of asymptotically large number of reflecting elements, while a constant proportional power loss is incurred that depends only on the number of phase-shift levels. The proposed designs for the single-user case are also extended to the general setup with multiple users among which some are aided by the IRS. Simulation results verify our performance analysis as well as the effectiveness of our proposed designs as compared to various benchmark schemes.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technique to enhance the wireless communication spectral efficiency with low hardware and energy cost. In this letter, we consider the integration of IRS to an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based multiuser downlink communication system, and study the pertinent joint optimization of the IRS reflection coefficients and OFDMA time-frequency resource block as well as power allocations to maximize the users' common (minimum) rate. Specifically, due to the lack of frequency-selective passive beamforming capability at the IRS, only one set of reflection coefficients can be designed for adapting to a large number of channels of multiple users over different frequency sub-bands. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a novel dynamic passive beamforming scheme where the IRS reflection coefficients are dynamically adjusted over different time slots within each channel coherence block to create artificial time-varying channels and select only a subset of the users to be simultaneously served in each time slot, thus achieving a higher passive beamforming gain. Although the formulated optimization problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to it. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the system common rate over the setup without IRS and that with random IRS reflection coefficients. Moreover, our proposed dynamic passive beamforming outperforms the fixed passive beamforming which employs a common set of reflection coefficients in each channel coherence block, by more flexibly balancing between passive beamforming and multiuser diversity gains.},

In this paper, we study a double-IRS assisted multi-user communication system with the cooperative passive beamforming design that captures the multiplicative beamforming gain from the inter-IRS channel. Under the general channel setup with the co-existence of both double- and single-reflection links, we jointly optimize the (active) receive beamforming at the base station (BS) and the cooperative (passive) reflect beamforming at the two distributed IRSs (deployed near the BS and users, respectively) to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of all users. Moreover, for the single-user and multi-user setups, we analytically show the superior performance of the double-IRS cooperative system over the conventional single-IRS system in terms of the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and multi-user effective channel rank, respectively. Simulation results validate our analytical results and show the practical advantages of the proposed double-IRS system with cooperative passive beamforming designs.},

In particular, we study the bistatic backscatter communication (BackCom) system assisted by an IRS. The phase shifts at the IRS are optimized jointly with the transmit beamforming vector of the carrier emitter to minimize the transmit power consumption at the carrier emitter whilst guaranteeing a required BackCom performance. The unique channel characteristics arising from multiple reflections at the IRS render the optimization problem highly non-convex. Therefore, we jointly utilize the minorization-maximization algorithm and the semidefinite relaxation technique to present an approximate solution for the optimal IRS phase shift design. We also extend our analytical results to the monostatic BackCom system. Numerical results indicate that the introduction of the IRS brings about considerable reductions in transmit power, even with moderate IRS sizes, which can be translated to range increases over the non-IRS-assisted BackCom system.},

   abstract = {In a backscatter communication system, the backscatter device (BD) transmits its messages to the backscatter receiver (BR) by reflecting the incident signal from an external radio frequency (RF) emitter, instead of using power-hungry active RF components themselves. Thus, backscatter communication has shown great potential for achieving low-power communication. The double-fading effect associated with the backscatter link, however, is a major limiting factor to achieve efficient backscatter communication. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), a recently developed technology, can be applied at the BD to enhance the backscatter link thanks to the fact that both RIS and backscatter communication share the same reflective principle. Such a design can also allow the backscatter communication system to capture the desired RF signal as a reflective carrier in a complex radio environment. In this article, a comprehensive overview of backscatter communication assisted by RIS is given. We first introduce the basics of backscatter communication, which covers the antenna scattering principle, backscatter modulation, and link budget calculation. Then, the details of RIS are discussed, which include antenna-based RIS and metamaterial-based RIS, followed by the discussion of the roles of RIS in backscatter communication. After that, we provide an overview of three types of backscatter communication systems assisted by RIS, including RIS-assisted unmodulated backscatter communication, RIS-assisted ambient backscatter communication, and RIS-assisted symbiotic radio. Emerging applications of these systems, technical challenges, and future opportunities in this emerging field are also presented.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance wireless information transmissions by adaptively controlling prorogation environment. Recently, the brand-new concept of utilizing IRS to implement a passive transmitter attracts researchers' attention since it potentially realizes low-complexity and hardware-efficient transmitters of multiple-input single/multiple-output (MISO/MIMO) systems. In this paper we investigate the problem of precoder design for a low-resolution IRS-based transmitter to implement multiuser MISO/MIMO wireless communications. Particularly, the IRS modulates information symbols by varying the phases of its reflecting elements and transmits them to K single-antenna or multi-antenna users. We first aim to design the symbol-level precoder for IRS to realize the modulation and minimize the maximum symbol-error-rate (SER) of single-antenna receivers. In order to tackle this NP-hard problem, we first relax the low-resolution phase-shift constraint and solve this problem by Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm. Then, the low-resolution symbol-level precoding vector is obtained by direct quantization. Considering the large quantization error for 1-bit resolution case, the branch-and-bound method is utilized to solve the 1-bit resolution symbol-level precoding vector. For multi-antenna receivers, we propose to iteratively design the symbol-level precoder and combiner by decomposing the original large-scale optimization problem into several sub-problems. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.},

In addition, a novel signaling strategy based on layered encoding is proposed that enables practical successive cancellation-type decoding at the receiver.

In this paper, we bring the concept of RIS-assisted communications to the realm of index modulation (IM) by proposing RIS-space shift keying (RIS-SSK) and RIS-spatial modulation (RIS-SM) schemes. These two schemes are realized through not only intelligent reflection of the incoming signals to improve the reception but also utilization of the IM principle for the indices of multiple receive antennas in a clever way to improve the spectral efficiency. Maximum energy-based suboptimal (greedy) and exhaustive search-based optimal (maximum likelihood) detectors of the proposed RIS-SSK/SM schemes are formulated and a unified framework is presented for the derivation of their theoretical average bit error probability. Extensive computer simulation results are provided to assess the potential of RIS-assisted IM schemes as well as to verify our theoretical derivations. Our findings also reveal that RIS-based IM, which enables high data rates with remarkably low error rates, can become a potential candidate for future wireless communication systems in the context of beyond multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) solutions.},

Based on the IRS's symbol period, we distinguish two scenarios, namely, commensal SR (CSR) and parasitic SR (PSR), where two different techniques for decoding the IRS signals at the IR are employed. We formulate bit error rate (BER) minimization problems for both scenarios by jointly optimizing the active beamformer at the base station and the phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a minimum primary rate requirement. Specifically, for the CSR scenario, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality solution, where semi-closed-form solutions for the active beamformer and the IRS phase shifts are derived based on Lagrange duality and Majorization-Minimization methods, respectively. For the PSR scenario, we apply a bisection search-based method, successive convex approximation, and difference of convex programming to develop a computationally efficient algorithm, which converges to a locally optimal solution.

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) adapts phase shift response to alter channel strength in specific directions. In this paper, we unify those two seemingly different technologies (and their derivatives) into one architecture called RIScatter. RIScatter is a batteryless cognitive radio that recycles ambient signal in an adaptive and customizable manner, where dispersed or co-located scatter nodes partially modulate their information and partially engineer the wireless channel. The key is to render the probability distribution of reflection states as a joint function of the information source, Channel State Information (CSI), and relative priority of coexisting links. This enables RIScatter to softly bridge BackCom and RIS; reduce to either in special cases; or evolve in a mixed form for heterogeneous traffic control and universal hardware design. We also propose a low-complexity Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC)-free receiver that exploits the properties of RIScatter. For a single-user multi-node network, we characterize the achievable primary-(total-)backscatter rate region by optimizing the input distribution at scatter nodes, the active beamforming at the Access Point (AP), and the energy decision regions at the user.

However, developing straightforward and tractable electromagnetic (EM) models that are suitable for IRS aided communication modeling remains an open issue. In this paper, we address this issue and derive communication models by using rigorous scattering parameter network analysis. We also propose new IRS architectures based on group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks, which are more general and more efficient than conventional single connected reconfigurable impedance network. In addition, the scaling law of the received signal power of an IRS aided system with reconfigurable impedance networks is also derived. Compared with the single connected reconfigurable impedance network, our group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance network can increase the received signal power by up to 62%, or maintain the same received signal power with a number of IRS elements reduced by up to 21%. We also investigate the proposed architecture in deployments with distance-dependent pathloss and Rician fading channel, and show that the proposed group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks outperform the single connected case by up to 34% and 48%, respectively.},

   abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) allow controlling the propagation environment in wireless networks by tuning multiple reflecting elements. RISs have been traditionally realized through single connected architectures, mathematically characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix. Recently, beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs) have been proposed as a novel branch of RISs whose scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal, which creates new benefits and opportunities for RISs. Efficient BD-RIS architectures have been realized based on group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks. However, a closed-form solution for the global optimal scattering matrix of these architectures is not yet available. In this paper, we provide such a closed-form solution proving that the theoretical performance upper bounds can be exactly achieved for any channel realization. We first consider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input single-output (SISO) systems aided by a BD-RIS working in reflective or transmissive mode. Then, we extend our solution to single-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. We show that our algorithm is less complex than the iterative optimization algorithms employed in the previous literature. The complexity of our algorithm grows linearly (resp. cubically) with the number of RIS elements in the case of group (resp. fully) connected architectures.},

BD-RIS has a scattering matrix that is not restricted to being diagonal and thus brings a performance improvement over conventional RIS. While different BD-RIS architectures have been proposed, it still remains an open problem to develop a systematic approach to design BD-RIS architectures achieving the optimal trade-off between performance and circuit complexity. In this work, we propose novel modeling, architecture design, and optimization for BD-RIS based on graph theory. This graph theoretical modeling allows us to develop two new efficient BD-RIS architectures, denoted as tree-connected and forest-connected RIS. Tree-connected RIS, whose corresponding graph is a tree, is proven to be the least complex BD-RIS architecture able to achieve the performance upper bound in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. Besides, forest-connected RIS allows us to strike a balance between performance and complexity, further decreasing the complexity over tree-connected RIS. To optimize tree-connected RIS, we derive a closed-form global optimal solution, while forest-connected RIS is optimized through a low-complexity iterative algorithm. Numerical results confirm that tree-connected (resp. forest-connected) RIS achieves the same performance as fully-connected (resp. group-connected) RIS, while reducing the complexity by up to 16.4 times.},

In order to maximize the achievable sum-DoF, an integer optimization problem is formulated to optimize the number of eliminating interference links by RIS beamforming. As a result, the derived achievable sum-DoF can be higher than the sum-DoF of two-user MIMO IC, leading to a RIS gain.

The objective of this paper is to minimize the total transmit power at the Radcom BS by jointly optimizing the active beamformers, including communication beamformers and radar beamformers, at the Radcom BS and the phase shifts at the IRS, subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) required by communication users, the minimum SINR required by the radar, and the cross-correlation pattern design. In particular, we consider two cases, namely, case I and case II, based on the presence or absence of the radar cross-correlation design and the interference introduced by the IRS on the Radcom BS. For case I where the cross-correlation design and the interference are not considered, we prove that the dedicated radar signals are not needed, which significantly reduces implementation complexity and simplifies algorithm design. Then, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Whereas for case II considering the cross-correlation design and the interference, we unveil that the dedicated radar signals are needed in general to enhance the system performance. Since the resulting optimization problem is more challenging to solve as compared with the case I, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed. Particularly, instead of relying on the Gaussian randomization technique to obtain an approximate solution by reconstructing rank-one solution, the tightness is achieved by our proposed reconstruction strategy.

To this end, we first study three special cases of the dynamic IRS beamforming,namely user-adaptive IRS beamforming, UL-adaptive IRS beamforming, and static IRS beamforming,by characterizing their optimal performance relationships and proposing corresponding algorithms. Interestingly, it is rigorously proved that the latter two cases achieve the same throughput, thus helping halve the number of IRS phase shifts to be optimized and signalling overhead practically required for UL-adaptive IRS beamforming. Then, we propose a general optimization framework for dynamic IRS beamforming, which is applicable for any given number of IRS phase-shift vectors available. Despite of the non-convexity of the general problem with highly coupled optimization variables, we propose two algorithms to solve it and particularly, the low-complexity algorithm exploits the intrinsic structure of the optimal solution as well as the solutions to the cases with user-adaptive and static IRS beamforming. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, illustrate the practical significance of IRS with dynamic beamforming for spectral and energy efficient WPCNs, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs over various benchmark schemes.},

   abstract = {The performance of Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) is mainly constrained by the received Radio-Frequency (RF) signal strength. To tackle this problem, we introduce an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) to compensate the propagation loss and boost the transmission efficiency. This paper proposes a novel IRS-aided SWIPT system where a multi-carrier multi-antenna Access Point (AP) transmits information and power simultaneously, with the assist of an IRS, to a single-antenna User Equipment (UE) employing practical receiving schemes. Considering harvester nonlinearity, we characterize the achievable Rate-Energy (R-E) region through a joint optimization of waveform, active and passive beamforming based on the Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). This problem is solved by the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method, where we obtain the active precoder in closed form, the passive beamforming by the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) approach, and the waveform amplitude by the Geometric Programming (GP) technique. To facilitate practical implementation, we also propose a low-complexity design based on closed-form adaptive waveform schemes. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed algorithms bring considerable R-E gains with robustness to CSIT inaccuracy and finite IRS states, and emphasize the importance of modeling harvester nonlinearity in the IRS-aided SWIPT design.},

Generalized multi-user and low complexity single-user algorithms are demonstrated based on alternating optimization (AO) framework to maximize the weighted sum output direct current (DC), subject to the transmit power constraints and passive beamforming modulus constraints. The input signal waveform and IRS passive beamforming phase shifts are jointly designed as a function of users’ individual frequency-selective channel state information (CSI). The energy harvester nonlinearity is explored and two IRS deployment schemes, namely frequency selective IRS (FS-IRS) and frequency flat IRS (FF-IRS), are modeled and analyzed. This paper highlights the fact that IRS can provide an extra passive beamforming gain on output DC power over conventional WPT designs and significantly influence the waveform design by leveraging the benefit of passive beamforming, frequency diversity and energy harvester nonlinearity. Even though FF-IRS exhibits lower output DC than the ideal FS-IRS, it still achieves substantially increased DC power over conventional WPT designs. Performance evaluations confirm the significant benefits of a joint waveform and passive beamforming design accounting for the energy harvester nonlinearity to boost the performance of single-user and multi-user WPT systems.},

   abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a promising technology for future wireless communications. With various hardware realizations, RISs can work under different modes (reflective/transmissive/hybrid) or have different architectures (single/group/fully-connected). However, most existing research focused on single-connected reflective RISs, mathematically characterized by diagonal phase shift matrices, while there is a lack of a comprehensive study for RISs unifying different modes/architectures. In this paper, we solve this issue by analyzing and proposing a general RIS-aided communication model. Specifically, we establish an RIS model not limited to diagonal phase shift matrices, a novel branch referred to as beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), unifying modes and architectures. With the proposed model, we develop efficient algorithms to jointly design transmit precoder and BD-RIS matrix to maximize the sum-rate for RIS-aided systems. We also provide simulation results to compare the performance of BD-RISs with different modes/architectures. Simulation results show that under the same mode, fully- and group-connected RIS can effectively increase the sum-rate performance compared with single-connected RIS, and that hybrid RIS outperforms reflective/transmissive RIS with the same architecture.},

In our previous work, we have analyzed and proposed a beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) model, which is not limited to traditional diagonal phase shift matrices, to unify different RIS modes/architectures. In this paper, we create a new branch of BD-RIS supporting a multi-sector mode. A multi-sector BD-RIS is modeled as multiple antennas connected to a multi-port group-connected reconfigurable impedance network. More specifically, antennas are divided into L ( L ≥ 2 ) sectors and arranged as a polygon prism with each sector covering 1/L space. Different from the recently introduced concept of intelligent omni-surface (or simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS), the multi-sector BD-RIS not only achieves a full-space coverage, but also has significant performance gains thanks to the highly directional beam of each sector. We derive the constraint of the multi-sector BD-RIS and the corresponding channel model taking into account the relationship between antenna beamwidth and gain. With the proposed model, we first derive the scaling law of the received signal power for a multi-sector BD-RIS -assisted single-user system. We then propose efficient beamforming design algorithms to maximize the sum-rate of the multi-sector BD-RIS -assisted multiuser system.

A modern mathematical proof is not very different from a modern machine, or a modern test setup: the simple fundamental principles are hidden and almost invisible under a mass of technical details. Hermann Weyl A long-standing problem in linear algebra-Alfred Horn's conjecture on eigenval-ues of sums of Hermitian matrices-has been solved recently. The solution appeared in two papers, one by Alexander Klyachko [20] in 1998 and the other by Allen Knut-son and Terence Tao [23] in 1999. This has been followed by a flurry of activity that has brought to the mathematical centre-stage what for many years had been somewhat of a side-show. The aim of this article is to describe the problem, its origins, some of the early work on it, and some ideas that have gone into its solution. A substantial part of this article should be accessible to anyone who has had a second course on linear algebra. The reader who wants to know more will find it rewarding to read the comprehensive and advanced account [11] by William Fulton. 1. LINEARITY, QUASILINEARITY, AND CONVEXITY The principal characters in our story are n × n Hermitian matrices A and B, their sum C = A + B, and the eigenvalues of A, B, and C enumerated as α 1 ≥ α 2 ≥ · · · ≥ α n , β 1 ≥ β 2 ≥ · · · ≥ β n , and γ 1 ≥ γ 2 ≥ · · · ≥ γ n , respectively. Sometimes we would like to emphasize the dependence of the eigenvalues on the matrix. We then use the notation λ ↓ j (A) for the jth eigenvalue of A when the eigenvalues are arranged in a (weakly) decreasing order. Thus α j = λ ↓ j (A). This n-tuple of eigenvalues of A as a whole is denoted by α or λ ↓ (A). The story begins with a simple question: what are the relationships between α, β, and γ ? Now, the eigenvalues are not linear functions of A and no simple relation between α, β, and γ is apparent, except one. The trace of A, denoted tr A is the sum of the diagonal entries of A and also of the eigenvalues of A. So, tr C = tr A + tr B and hence n j=1},

Specifically, our focus is on analysing the spatial multiplexing gains in line‐of‐sight and low‐scattering MIMO channels in the near field. We prove that the channel capacity is achieved by diagonalising the end‐to‐end transmitter‐RIS‐receiver channel, and applying the water‐filling power allocation to the ordered product of the singular values of the transmitter‐RIS and RIS‐receiver channels. The obtained capacity‐achieving solution requires an RIS with a non‐diagonal matrix of reflection coefficients. Under the assumption of nearly‐passive RIS, that is, no power amplification is needed at the RIS, the water‐filling power allocation is necessary only at the transmitter. We refer to this design of RIS as a linear, nearly‐passive, reconfigurable electromagnetic object (EMO). In addition, we introduce a closed‐form and low‐complexity design for RIS, whose matrix of reflection coefficients is diagonal with unit‐modulus entries. The reflection coefficients are given by the product of two focusing functions: one steering the RIS‐aided signal towards the mid‐point of the MIMO transmitter and one steering the RIS‐aided signal towards the mid‐point of the MIMO receiver. We prove that this solution is exact in line‐of‐sight channels under the paraxial setup. With the aid of extensive numerical simulations in line‐of‐sight (free‐space) channels, we show that the proposed approach offers performance (rate and degrees of freedom) close to that obtained by numerically solving non‐convex optimization problems at a high computational complexity. Also, we show that it provides performance close to that achieved by the EMO (non‐diagonal RIS) in most of the considered case studies.},

   abstract = {Recently, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as an appealing technique that enables wireless communications with low hardware cost and low power consumption. In this letter, we consider an IRS-assisted point-to-point multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system, where a source communicates with its destination with the help of an IRS. Our goal is to maximize the spectral efficiency of this system by jointly optimizing the (active) precoding at the source and the (passive) phase shifters (PSs) at the IRS. However, this turns out to be an intractable mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To circumvent the intractability, we propose a new sum-path-gain maximization (SPGM) criterion to obtain a high-quality and efficient suboptimal solution to this problem. Specifically, the PSs are first designed based on a simplified optimization problem, which aims to maximize the sum-gains of the spatial paths between the source and the destination. Then, a low-complexity alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is utilized to solve this simplified problem. Finally, with the above obtained PSs, the source precoding is derived by performing the singular value decomposition (SVD) on the effective channel between the source and the destination. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve near-optimal performance.},

   abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising solution that can reconfigure a mmWave MIMO channel at low cost. This letter first investigates the improvement caused by multiple RISs on the rank and the condition number of the mmWave MIMO channel matrix. Then it demonstrates that as the number of RISs increases, the mmWave channel can be characterized by a spatially correlated Rayleigh channel, which has a rich scattering environment as a traditional microwave channel. Finally, the simulation results verify the derived closed-form expressions for the variance of the equivalent Rayleigh fading channel matrix with random or optimized RIS phase shifts.},

   abstract = {Electromagnetic field theory provides the physics of radio communications, while information theory approaches the problem from a purely mathematical point of view. While there is a law of conservation of energy in physics, there is no such law in information theory. Consequently, when, in information theory, reference is made (as it frequently is) to terms like energy, power, noise, or antennas, it is by no means guaranteed that their use is consistent with the physics of the communication system. Circuit theoretic multiport concepts can help in bridging the gap between the physics of electromagnetic fields and the mathematical world of information theory, so that important terms like energy or antenna are indeed used consistently through all layers of abstraction. In this paper, we develop circuit theoretic multiport models for radio communication systems. To demonstrate the utility of the circuit theoretic approach, an in-depth analysis is provided on the impact of impedance matching, antenna mutual coupling, and different sources of noise on the performance of the communication system. Interesting insights are developed about the role of impedance matching and the noise properties of the receive amplifiers, as well as the way array gain and channel capacity scale with the number of antennas in different circumstances. One particularly interesting result is that, with arrays of lossless antennas that receive isotropic background noise, efficient multistreaming can be achieved no matter how densely the antennas are packed. © 2006 IEEE.},

These manifolds represent the constraints that arise in such areas as the symmetric eigenvalue problem, nonlinear eigenvalue problems, electronic structures computations, and signal processing. In addition to the new algorithms, we show how the geometrical framework gives penetrating new insights allowing us to create, understand, and compare algorithms. The theory proposed here provides a taxonomy for numerical linear algebra algorithms that provide a top level mathematical view of previously unrelated algorithms. It is our hope that developers of new algorithms and perturbation theories will benefit from the theory, methods, and examples in this paper.},
