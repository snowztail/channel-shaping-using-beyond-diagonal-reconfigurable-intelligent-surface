   abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) allow controlling the propagation environment in wireless networks by tuning multiple reflecting elements. RISs have been traditionally realized through single connected architectures, mathematically characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix. Recently, beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs) have been proposed as a novel branch of RISs whose scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal, which creates new benefits and opportunities for RISs. Efficient BD-RIS architectures have been realized based on group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks. However, a closed-form solution for the global optimal scattering matrix of these architectures is not yet available. In this paper, we provide such a closed-form solution proving that the theoretical performance upper bounds can be exactly achieved for any channel realization. We first consider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input single-output (SISO) systems aided by a BD-RIS working in reflective or transmissive mode. Then, we extend our solution to single-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. We show that our algorithm is less complex than the iterative optimization algorithms employed in the previous literature. The complexity of our algorithm grows linearly (resp. cubically) with the number of RIS elements in the case of group (resp. fully) connected architectures.},

However, university curricula need to emphasize guaranteeing the acquisition of transversal competencies that are essential for the future management professionals required by this new challenge Consistent and critical thinking is considered a fundamental skill for education in sustainability. To date, no studies have presented an objective measure of the level of acquisition of such transverse skills in university curricula. This study provides an analytical tool to that end, based on the multi-criteria decision-making technique Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Through sustainability-oriented case studies, students are faced with real managerial decision-making problems. The proposed method allows for the analytic quantification of the consistency of their responses. Such consistency is representative of their critical thinking skills. The proposed tool allows teachers not only to find the consistency of their students' responses but also to understand in which areas of sustainability students lack a clear vision of the problem. This tool is therefore useful for teachers to effectively adapt their syllabi according to their students' knowledge.},

   abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a promising technology for future wireless communications. With various hardware realizations, RISs can work under different modes (reflective/transmissive/hybrid) or have different architectures (single/group/fully-connected). However, most existing research focused on single-connected reflective RISs, mathematically characterized by diagonal phase shift matrices, while there is a lack of a comprehensive study for RISs unifying different modes/architectures. In this paper, we solve this issue by analyzing and proposing a general RIS-aided communication model. Specifically, we establish an RIS model not limited to diagonal phase shift matrices, a novel branch referred to as beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), unifying modes and architectures. With the proposed model, we develop efficient algorithms to jointly design transmit precoder and BD-RIS matrix to maximize the sum-rate for RIS-aided systems. We also provide simulation results to compare the performance of BD-RISs with different modes/architectures. Simulation results show that under the same mode, fully- and group-connected RIS can effectively increase the sum-rate performance compared with single-connected RIS, and that hybrid RIS outperforms reflective/transmissive RIS with the same architecture.},

   abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has gained much traction due to its potential to manipulate the propagation environment via nearly-passive reconfigurable elements. In our previous work, we have analyzed and proposed a beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) model, which is not limited to traditional diagonal phase shift matrices, to unify different RIS modes/architectures. In this paper, we create a new branch of BD-RIS supporting a multi-sector mode. A multi-sector BD-RIS is modeled as multiple antennas connected to a multi-port group-connected reconfigurable impedance network. More specifically, antennas are divided into L ( L ≥ 2 ) sectors and arranged as a polygon prism with each sector covering 1/L space. Different from the recently introduced concept of intelligent omni-surface (or simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS), the multi-sector BD-RIS not only achieves a full-space coverage, but also has significant performance gains thanks to the highly directional beam of each sector. We derive the constraint of the multi-sector BD-RIS and the corresponding channel model taking into account the relationship between antenna beamwidth and gain. With the proposed model, we first derive the scaling law of the received signal power for a multi-sector BD-RIS -assisted single-user system. We then propose efficient beamforming design algorithms to maximize the sum-rate of the multi-sector BD-RIS -assisted multiuser system. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed design and demonstrate the performance enhancement of the proposed multi-sector BD-RIS.},

   abstract = {In the past as well as present wireless communication systems, the wireless propagation environment is regarded as an uncontrollable black box that impairs the received signal quality, and its negative impacts are compensated for by relying on the design of various sophisticated transmission/reception schemes. However, the improvements through applying such schemes operating only at two endpoints (i.e., transmitter and receiver) are limited even after five generations of wireless systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) or intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) have emerged as a new and promising technology that can configure the wireless environment in a favorable manner by properly tuning the phase shifts of a large number of quasi passive and low-cost reflecting elements, thus standing out as a promising candidate technology for the next/sixth-generation (6G) wireless system. However, to reap the performance benefits promised by RIS/IRS, efficient signal processing techniques are crucial, for a variety of purposes such as channel estimation, transmission design, radio localization, and so on. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances on RIS/IRS-aided wireless systems from the signal processing perspective.We also highlight promising research directions that are worthy of investigation in the future.},

   abstract = {We want first an overview of the aim and of the road; we want to understand the idea of the proof, the deeper context. A modern mathematical proof is not very different from a modern machine, or a modern test setup: the simple fundamental principles are hidden and almost invisible under a mass of technical details. Hermann Weyl A long-standing problem in linear algebra-Alfred Horn's conjecture on eigenval-ues of sums of Hermitian matrices-has been solved recently. The solution appeared in two papers, one by Alexander Klyachko [20] in 1998 and the other by Allen Knut-son and Terence Tao [23] in 1999. This has been followed by a flurry of activity that has brought to the mathematical centre-stage what for many years had been somewhat of a side-show. The aim of this article is to describe the problem, its origins, some of the early work on it, and some ideas that have gone into its solution. A substantial part of this article should be accessible to anyone who has had a second course on linear algebra. The reader who wants to know more will find it rewarding to read the comprehensive and advanced account [11] by William Fulton. 1. LINEARITY, QUASILINEARITY, AND CONVEXITY The principal characters in our story are n × n Hermitian matrices A and B, their sum C = A + B, and the eigenvalues of A, B, and C enumerated as α 1 ≥ α 2 ≥ · · · ≥ α n , β 1 ≥ β 2 ≥ · · · ≥ β n , and γ 1 ≥ γ 2 ≥ · · · ≥ γ n , respectively. Sometimes we would like to emphasize the dependence of the eigenvalues on the matrix. We then use the notation λ ↓ j (A) for the jth eigenvalue of A when the eigenvalues are arranged in a (weakly) decreasing order. Thus α j = λ ↓ j (A). This n-tuple of eigenvalues of A as a whole is denoted by α or λ ↓ (A). The story begins with a simple question: what are the relationships between α, β, and γ ? Now, the eigenvalues are not linear functions of A and no simple relation between α, β, and γ is apparent, except one. The trace of A, denoted tr A is the sum of the diagonal entries of A and also of the eigenvalues of A. So, tr C = tr A + tr B and hence n j=1},

   abstract = {We consider a multiple‐input multiple‐output (MIMO) channel in the presence of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Specifically, our focus is on analysing the spatial multiplexing gains in line‐of‐sight and low‐scattering MIMO channels in the near field. We prove that the channel capacity is achieved by diagonalising the end‐to‐end transmitter‐RIS‐receiver channel, and applying the water‐filling power allocation to the ordered product of the singular values of the transmitter‐RIS and RIS‐receiver channels. The obtained capacity‐achieving solution requires an RIS with a non‐diagonal matrix of reflection coefficients. Under the assumption of nearly‐passive RIS, that is, no power amplification is needed at the RIS, the water‐filling power allocation is necessary only at the transmitter. We refer to this design of RIS as a linear, nearly‐passive, reconfigurable electromagnetic object (EMO). In addition, we introduce a closed‐form and low‐complexity design for RIS, whose matrix of reflection coefficients is diagonal with unit‐modulus entries. The reflection coefficients are given by the product of two focusing functions: one steering the RIS‐aided signal towards the mid‐point of the MIMO transmitter and one steering the RIS‐aided signal towards the mid‐point of the MIMO receiver. We prove that this solution is exact in line‐of‐sight channels under the paraxial setup. With the aid of extensive numerical simulations in line‐of‐sight (free‐space) channels, we show that the proposed approach offers performance (rate and degrees of freedom) close to that obtained by numerically solving non‐convex optimization problems at a high computational complexity. Also, we show that it provides performance close to that achieved by the EMO (non‐diagonal RIS) in most of the considered case studies.},
